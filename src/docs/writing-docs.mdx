## Writing Docs

MDX is a great choice for composing documentation!

### Simple Use Case

Demonstrating the UI visually _and_ providing copy-and-paste examples has many advantages.

<SimpleUseCase />

### Tooltip Example

In previous example, it will be easy enough to keep the _source_ and _UI_ consistent because the example is trivial _and_ they are co-located on the filesystem. For non-trivial examples, consider using a `babel-macro` or other `raw-loader` methods to _import_ them both, ensuring they stay in sync.
