# MDX with Parcel

A demo project to augment [presentation slides](bit.ly/love-mdx)

## Play Along

I'm planning to jump to the `start` (a git tag) position, and walk forward in version control history, explaining as I go.

```sh
git checkout start
yarn start
```

Probably have a GUI open to conveniently walk the commit history.
