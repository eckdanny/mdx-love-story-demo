## About

This is a _demo project_ to illustrate some of the cool features of `mdx`. I'm talking about [in a slide deck](https://bit.ly/love-mdx).

## Play Along

If you want to _sing-a-long_ clone the repo and checkout `start` (git tag). From here you can walk forward in version control to see how it comes together.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eckdanny/mdx-love-story-demo && cd $_
yarn
git checkout start && yarn start
```

_Enjoy!_
